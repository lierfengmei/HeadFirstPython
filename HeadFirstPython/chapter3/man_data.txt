['Jingle bells, jingle bells Jingle all the way Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one horse open', 'Dashing through the snow', 'In a one horse open sleigh', 'Over the fields we go', 'Laughing all the way', "A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride", 'And soon miss fanny bright', 'The horse was lean and lank', 'He got into and drifted back, and we were got upset']
